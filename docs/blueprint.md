- Background color: Light blue (#E6EFFF), a heavily desaturated tint of the primary, to keep the user focused on the content with a robot sketch pattern in the background.
- Accent color: Lavender (#E6E6FA) to add a calming feel to page elements, buttons and hovers.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif font for both headings and body, for its techy feel.
- Utilize clean and minimalistic icons that align with the futuristic robotic theme.
- Maintain a balanced layout to evenly distribute content sections for a harmonious design.
- Implement scroll-triggered animations to reveal hidden content as the user explores the homepage.
